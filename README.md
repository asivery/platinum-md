#### Dependancies

##### OSX

You will need to install homebrew: https://docs.brew.sh/Installation

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

Then install the following:

`brew install --force pkg-config qt5 mad libid3tag libtag glib libusb libusb-compat libgcrypt ffmpeg json-c && brew link --force qt5`

##### Windows

You will need to use Zadig to install the WinUSB Driver.
Connect your NetMD device, open the app and click the "Install Driver" button.
Please note, this will disable Sonic Stage from having access to the device, you'll need to run Zadig and 'reinstall' the old driver to use it again.

https://zadig.akeo.ie/

##### Linux

Note: This has only been tested on Ubuntu.

Run `apt-get install libgcrypt20-dev libglib2.0-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev qt4-qmake libid3tag0-dev libmad0-dev`

You will also likely need to allow your user permissions to the USB/NetMD Device.
This is a 'catch-all' but you may wish to add a specific deviceId/vendorId if you want to lock permissions down.
`sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/50-device.rules` and add `SUBSYSTEM=="usb", GROUP="YOURUSERGROUPHERE"`

#### Download & Installation

##### OSX

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gavinbenda/platinum-md/releases/download/v0.7.0-alpha/platinum-md-0.7.0.dmg), and open the dmg.

Drag the file to the applications folder.

Upon opening the `platinum-md` app from the applications folder, it will show a warning.

Open OSX `Settings` and click `Security & Privacy` - click the `Open Anyway` button shown near the bottom of the panel.

##### Windows

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gavinbenda/platinum-md/releases/download/v0.7.0-alpha/platinum-md.Setup.0.7.0.exe), and open the platinum-md .exe Setup file.

Run the installer, don't forget to run Zadig above.


##### Linux

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gavinbenda/platinum-md/releases/download/v0.7.0-alpha/platinum-md-0.7.0.AppImage), and open the platinum-md AppImage Setup file.


## Features

Supports upload MP3/WAV/FLAC files direct to a compatible NetMD recorder.

Full quality SP recording.

LP2/LP4 with an experimental encoder


## Release Notes

This is a very alpha release, expect bugs.
Please report any bugs using the GitHub Issues feature.


## Troubleshooting

* Make sure you have a disk in the device before connecting.
* If the interface shows "Negotiating with device" but won't connect, click the `retry` button.
* If using Windows, ensure you've correctly installed the driver using Zadig (instructions above).
* To access debug information, click `settings` and click the `debug window` button.
* Some discs origionally made with SonicStage may not allow for tracks to be deleted by Platinum-MD.
* Windows anti-virus software may sometimes incorrectly mark the app as a positive.
* Ensure that there is a disc in the device. It must be a standard formatted disc, not Hi-MD, etc.
* Set disc mode to "MD" - on your MD device, this is ususally under `Options` -> `Disc Mode` -> set to `MD`. This is ususally only an issue when using a blank disc.
* Interfacing devices that are almost 20 years old will always be a little finnicky, so expect sometimes you may just have to un-plug/plug-in again.
* There may be some useful information in the Platinum-MD debug window. To access, click `Settings` and then click the `Debug Window` button.


## Known bugs / future Plans

* Some pre-recorded discs made with SonicStage may show as blank
* Transfering tracks to MZ-NH700 (and possibly other Hi-MD devices) in NetMD mode fails when using a blank disc formatted as MD using a Hi-MD device. This is a bug in linux-minidisc. To work around this issue, format the disc in a non-himd recorder, or record a short track onto the disc using the NH700 and hit stop to save TOC, eject and power off the device, then insert disc and connect to computer.
* Some devices sometimes incorrectly show no tracks on disc, if this occurs clic refresh on the netmd pane. If the issue persists unplug the device from the computer, eject the disk and power down the device, then retry.
* Automatic CLI tools for installing dependancies is highly desirable
* The USB interface sometimes just fails, this is hard to fix as it seems to be the device itself (just unplug/plug-in again)
* LP2 is experimental, in my experience some tracks may have a slight hiss... this is an upstream issue.

## Donate

I do this as a personal project, and a few people have expressed interested in donating to keep the project going, this will simply go back into buying test hardware and/or possibly coffee.
